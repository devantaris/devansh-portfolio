# Testing

Currently, there is no formal testing framework configured (no Jest, Vitest, or Cypress).
- **Manual Verification:** Testing is performed manually by running `npm run build` and checking the production output, as well as testing performance on specific environments (like mobile/low-end hardware).
- **Future Implementation:** Add Playwright or Cypress for E2E testing of 3D canvasses and scrolling animations.
